while loops, do/while loops, and for loops

Break keyword allows us ot exit a loop at any point.
Any code after the break keyword will NOT be executed.
Break will not exit the program. It exits the loop and the program picks up execution after the loop.



In a do/while loop, the conditional check is placed at the end of the loop as opposed to the beginning (as in the case with a while loop).

We want the action to be executed at least one time no matter what (classic use case for do/while loop)

For loops have a definite end since it's looping over a finite number of elements.


A range is a special type in Ruby that captures a range of elements. 1..3 captures 1, 2, 3

Iterators

Methods that loop over a given set of data and all you to operate on each element in the collection.

Each time we iterate over the array (using .each method), we need to assign the value of the element to a variable. This is placed between the pipes. 

The logic that we want to use to operate on the variable is written, which represents the current array element.

A block is just some lines of code ready to be executed.

Recursion 

Recursion is the act of calling a method from within itself.

Baseline condition that returns a value, which then unwinds the recursive calls.
